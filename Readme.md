### Bias at each hour

![Bias at each hour](./plots/bias_1hr.png)

- at night there is less bias
- negative bias in the south and north. positive bias in the middle
- **least bias** around 17:00-18:00

### Violin plot of bias at each hour

- two outliers at the bottom are **Canadian Breaks Wind** and **Desert Sky repower**

## Std

### Std at 24 Hours interval

- low std farms tend to stay low, high std farms tend to stay high
- Kendall's <!-- $\tau$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Ctau"> is higher in the morning

#### kendall's coefficient for each region

### Conclusion for these bump charts

- In general, across all regions, kendall's <!-- $\tau$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Ctau"> is lower is the afternoon
- North Central Farms and West Farms have the highest average kendall's tau, while the South Farms have the lowest average kendall's tau.

## 95 percentile - mean (bias)

![95 percentile - mean (bias) at 24 Hours interval](./plots/bias_95quantile_minus_mean_1hr.png)

- larger in the afternoon until midnight

### Bump Charts 0-24hr

![95 percentile - mean (bias) at 24 Hours interval bump](./plots/bumpchart_quantile_0-24.png)

- low ones go high and high ones go low

## capacity vs unnormalized std

### Linear Regression

![capacity vs unnormalized std](./plots/capacity_vs_unnormstd.png)

- there is a strong correlation (<!-- $r^2 = 0.897$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=r%5E2%20%3D%200.897">) between capacity and unormalized std.
- Wind Farms at the south tend to have low unnormalized std/capacity ratio

![capacity vs unnormalized std by region](./plots/capacity_vs_unnormstd_by_region.png)

- the correlation coefficient for North Central is 0.9349458943175288
- the correlation coefficient for North is 0.9425002375847092
- the correlation coefficient for West is 0.9502674365455899
- the correlation coefficient for Far West is 0.9477938088833047
- the correlation coefficient for South is 0.8853149787430542
- the correlation coefficient for South Central is 0.9951808329420279 (**very linear**)

### LOWESS

### Spline

### Polynomials

### Piecewise

## capacity vs unnormalized error

### Linear Regression

![capacity vs unnormalized error](./plots/capacity_vs_unnormerror.png)

- the correlation is small (<!-- $r^2 = 0.1294979748653919$ --> <img style="transform: translateY(0.1em); background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=r%5E2%20%3D%200.1294979748653919">) so they are not quite correlated in general
- the south has higher correlation

![capacity vs unnormalized error by region](./plots/capacity_vs_unnormerror_by_region.png)

- the correlation coefficient for North Central is 0.7747808370036084
- the correlation coefficient for North is 0.0005175873342643005
- the correlation coefficient for West is 0.6142004020550921
- the correlation coefficient for Far West is 0.07272325563154991
- the correlation coefficient for South is 0.526982981239405
- the correlation coefficient for South Central is 0.9999375913105677

## Outliers

let outliers to be any oberservation outside the range

<!-- $$
\left[Q_{1}-k\left(Q_{3}-Q_{1}\right), Q_{3}+k\left(Q_{3}-Q_{1}\right)\right]
$$ --> 

<div align="center"><img style="background: white;" src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cleft%5BQ_%7B1%7D-k%5Cleft(Q_%7B3%7D-Q_%7B1%7D%5Cright)%2C%20Q_%7B3%7D%2Bk%5Cleft(Q_%7B3%7D-Q_%7B1%7D%5Cright)%5Cright%5D"></div>

Where Q1,Q3 are the quantile, k is some non-negative constant. We use k = 2 across all the analysis
