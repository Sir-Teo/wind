# Wind Farms Observations

## Bias

### Bias at 24 Hours interval

![Bias at 24 Hours interval](./plots/bias_24hr_with_area.png)

### Bias at each hour

![Bias at each hour](./plots/bias_1hr.png)

- at night there is less bias
- negative bias in the south and north. positive bias in the middle
- **least bias** around 17:00-18:00

### Violin plot of bias at each hour

- two outliers at the bottom are **Canadian Breaks Wind** and **Desert Sky repower**

## Std

### Std at 24 Hours interval

![Std at 24 Hours interval](./plots/std_of_bias_24hr.png)

- low std at the south and north, high std at the middle

### std of bias at each hour

![std of bias at each hour](./plots/std_of_bias_1hr.png)

- at the sourth std lower from midnight to noon

### Violin plot of std of bias at each hour

![Violin plot of std of bias at each hour](./plots/violin_and_box_std_of_bias_1hr.png)

- low std in the afternoon and the evening

### Bump Chart of std of bias at each hour

![Bump Chart of std of bias at each hour](./plots/std_bumpchart_all_farm_all_time.png)

- low std farms tend to stay low, high std farms tend to stay high
- crossing is less in the morning

#### Bump Chart of std of bias at each hour (West)

![Bump Chart of std of bias at each hour (West)](./plots/std_bumpchart_all_farm_all_time_West.png)

- less crossings comparing to other regions

#### Bump Chart of std of bias at each hour (Far West)

![Bump Chart of std of bias at each hour (Far West)](./plots/std_bumpchart_all_farm_all_time_FarWest.png)

- more "crossings" comparing to other regions

## 95 percentile - mean (bias)

![95 percentile - mean (bias) at 24 Hours interval](./plots/bias_95quantile_minus_mean_1hr.png)

- continuity
- larger in the afternoon until midnight
